1. when doing the handshake doesnt check if MP_CAPABLE is there or not, just assumes it is there.
    this is wrong, because the other side might not support MP_CAPABLE and thus not send it.

2. Assume both are going to use v1
3. Assume both use the same key (with value 2)
4. Can we assume that each host will have only connection (need to index connections by hash of key?) ?
5. I didnt check MPTCP flags (2nd octet)
6. Exhanges of crypto algorithm not doesnt
7. All the token and keys and HMACs are harcoded as 2 
8. Didnt store the Address ID mappings (Just used aadd id 1 for all refer point 4)
9. WHat about option lenght when adding all these options?
10.
